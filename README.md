# Welcome to DIRKU
The **D**eformable **I**mage **R**egistration **K**Ã¸benhavns **U**niversitet repository contains software developed at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen dealing with flow based image registration.

Publications based on this software are:
- pub1
- pub2

# Why use DIRKU?
Flow-based image registratino has some nice porperties. for example they allow you to deal with in its fully developed form with lrage defrmations and diffeomorphisms (LDDMM). with the right adjsutments free form deformations or stationatry velcoity field registration can be acheived.
it contains the most common similarity measuer (NMI, ncc, ssd) and additionally to that mutliple regularizers.
specially developed in concert with simulations, collision detection and self collision detection is part is it.
also we have postprocessing 
#Components
The core concept is widely used in iamge registration.
an energy functional describes the registration problem
